# Adaptive-Neural-Control-of-Uncertain-MIMO-Nonlinear-Pure-Feedback-Systems-via-Quantized-States
this repository is a control system implemention in Matlab which is proposed by BYUNG MO KIM et al.(DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165567)

the study presented a neural network baskstepping control for nonlinear uncertain non_affine system with qunatized states. a neural network is applied to approximate nonlinear uncertain function.
